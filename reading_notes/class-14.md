# How to remove malware from your Windows PC

Indicators of Malware:  atypical slow performance, excessive pop-ups, etc.

First - Disconnect from the internet to prevent  spread or private data leaks.

Boot back up in Microsoft Safe Mode to minimize programs and services, as a start-up in Normal mode can potentially trigger automatic malware loading into services. There are 2 different Safe Mode options, one of which allows Safe Mode with Networking (useful if you want to run an online scan). If your PC runs significantly faster in Safe Mode, this could be a possible indicator of malware infection... or simply that you’re running heavy-use programs during normal use.

Second - Use Windows disk-cleanup utility to delete temporary files. After that, run a malware scan.

Try running a different scanner than your normal one, because if your machine is infected, clearly the first line of defense failed to identify the threat.

There are two kinds of antivirus programs: 1) real-time scanners which run constantly in the background, and 2) on-demand scanners. It’s generally a good idea to have multiple different on-demand scanners installed and available to run a scan in time of need; because no single scan is capable of identifying all malware/viruses. Follow-up with a real-time full-system scan if you suspect an infection.

One example of an on-demand scanner is Malwarebytes. This can be downloaded for free online. If it’s not safe to connect your machine to the internet due to potential infection, an alternative option is to download the install file using a different machine and save that file to a USB drive. You then can and should run a “Default” scan from the Dashboard. Note that the program will usually check for updates first. Next it is recommended to run a “Threat” Scan, which most of the time will successfully locate the infection. Then select the option to remove any & all identified infection files through the Malwarebytes program.

If the Malwarebytes program keeps automatically going away when scanning, this can be an indicator that your machine is infected with a rootkit (a deep infection), in which case a new OS install may be in order. 

Next – Before launching the browser, check and verify that your homepage setting is correct; otherwise your PC could potentially get re-infected.

IF you have to re-install Windows, condolences. Back up your files and necessary application profiles (e.g. Outlook or Windows Mail) first, and if necessary back-up drivers or ensure you have everything needed to Re-install all your programs again later. There are several options available to assist with these – such as DoubleDriver and Hiren’s BootCD.  If you don’t have the Windows driver, you may be able to use your PC’s factory restore.

Last – Take measures to prevent future infections. Always run a real-time antivirus program, and keep it up-to-date. If you go to a lot of questionable websites, consider running in “sandbox mode” to protect your system from malware. It’s also a good idea to go through and review your online accounts at the end of your system clean-up to ensure that all is kosher; especially financial accounts, email and social networking. It doesn’t hurt to change passwords as well. Another recommended prevention measure is to scan your system backups for infection, if not completely delete them and just create brand new back-ups. And as always, keep Microsoft and Adobe products updated at all times.
