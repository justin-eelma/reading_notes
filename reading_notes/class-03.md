As a help desk professional, one must have multiple sets of skills of differing natures --"hard skills" and "soft skills". Not only are these skills required to perform the core aspects of a tech support job, but also to serve as a good and reputable "face" and representative of the business to customers.

Hard skills include characteristics such as critical thinking, trouble-shooting, technical abilities, and detailed knowledge of systems/applications/network infrastructure. Without hard skills, tech support personnel would be inadequate in performing their core job duties.

Soft skills are more-so related to human interactions; and include characteristics such as strong verbal and written communication skills, appropriately setting customer expectations, effectively guiding customers while providing service satisfaction to them, sometimes training customers to prevent or resolve future problems independently.

In addition to customer relations, soft skills are also imperative in working with and communicating with other tech-support personnel. This may include working in a team alongside other individuals, or participating in a virtual community of online boards or web-based resources.

Ultimately, without both hard and soft skills no individual would be a strong job candidate nor effective in their duties and teamwork in any customer-service based position; which account for the majority of help-desk service related jobs.
