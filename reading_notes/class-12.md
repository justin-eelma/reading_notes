- VPN Router
- Firewall
- DHCP / DNS Server
- Wireless Access Point
- Transparent Squid Proxy Server
- Multi Wan Router or Load Balancer

pfSense can be installed on embedded platforms that uses compact flash for storage, ex Soekris net5501, Alix. If you are converting an old PC into a router, it will need at least two network cards installed.
