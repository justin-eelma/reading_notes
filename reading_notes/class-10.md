# Imaging, Backup, and Recovery
### Get started with Veeam Backup Free Edition
Veeam BackUp & Replication is a program designed to backup, restore, and replicate data on virtual machines. Users can restore single VM files and OS files without extracting the entire stored VM. Restoring VM disks and entire VMs are also an option if they become corrupted. Veeam Backup can handle several virtual disks inside one VM. 

Veeam toolset:

  - <i>VeeamZip</i> allows the user to create backups of running VMs in a compressed format, resulting in a file size half of the actual VM being used. With version 7, a new compression algorithm significantly reduces file size compared to older versions, and as a result increased CPU availability. 

  - <i>Quick Migration</i> is a utility that allows transfering of VMs between databases.

  - <i>Native tape support</i> for enterprises that prefer storing on LTO tape drives. 

  - <i>VMware vCloud Director support</i> for users that use the VMware's cloud delivery platform.

  - <i>Veeam Explorer for MS SharePoint</i> is a built-in utility that can access content of VMs stored on Sharepoint.

  - <i>Veeam Explorer for MS Exchange</i> can access content within MS Exhange virtual machines without the need to extract the entire VM into production storage.
