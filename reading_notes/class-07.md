## Should you learn PowerShell?
PowerShell is a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft that enables system admins and power users to manage computers from the command line. Similar to Bourne Again Shell, Powershell has a scripting language that can be used to automate admin tasks. "Cmdlets" are used to perform actions within PowerShell. Unlike similar programming languages that create applications or websites, PowerShell in an interpreter for 'doing things' as it relates to management within a technology environment. The job titles associated with PowerShell are: Systems Administrator, Network Admin, Systems Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Systems Development Engineer, Cloud Architect, and Systems Architect. 
### Linux vs Windows 
#### Linux --> Bash --> Python || Windows --> Powershell --> C#
  - Unix shell works with strings; Microsoft command-line works with objects.
  - Bash passes output and input as plain text; PowerShell scripts pass entire data objects structures between commands.
  - Bash Shell push around globs of text; PowerShell pipes objects along the output of one cmdlet as the input for another.
#### Why PowerShell?
PowerShell is available on most major platforms, including most cloud based platforms. It is a powerful language that deals with automation efficiently. PowerShell can test outcomes and ensure accurate results. The community is one of the most connected and welcoming in tech. 

## Who needs malware? 
According to IBM, 43% of attacks did not use locally installed files, but rather used direct-to-memory attacks via PowerShell scripts. Admins can no longer rely solely on executables living on local storage. Hackers use PowerShell scripts to forego the file system and inject code directly into memory. The biggest target is coorporate data, in addition to that, passwords and other personal identifiable information become at risk.
