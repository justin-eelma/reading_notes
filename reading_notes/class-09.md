# Readings: Workstation Deployment SOP
## Standard Operating Procedures
An SOP is a policy that hold instructions for the purpose to enforce how to carry out specific tasks within an organization. How SOPs are written are an important aspect of successful implementation. Poorly written SOPs can open the policy up for misinterpretation which can become misconstrued and have negative impacts on a company. Three sections to hit on while creating an SOP are: 
  - Policy: the opening statement that answers the purpose
  - SOP: answers "what, when, and why" - needs to be specific as there may be multiple SOPs that are related to a single topic. 
  - Work Instructions: answers "how" - the instructions to carry out the SOP
 ### Why SOPs?
 Policies steer an organization in a particular direction that they see suitable for their vision and business model. 
 ### The Elements of a successful SOP
  - Maintained. Regularly update the SOP to stay current with new technologies or methodologies
  - Readable. An easy to follow layout with organized formatting. Using flowcharts and diagrams help visualize steps.
  - Consumbale. Write in a way that can be understood by the entire organization. Understand your audience.
  - Actionable. Clearly worded objective.
  - Measureable. Avoid vaguity. 

Before writing an SOP, establish a good outline or flowchart describing all the elements of the policy. Create examples within your flowchart to demonstrate a relatable scenario. Keep the SOP succinct to the objective, avoid unnecesary tangents. 
In the heading of the policy, an opening statement describing the SOP should be present to help the reader fully understand what they have.
Remember, SOPs are designed to supplement and expand upon knowledge, not to be used as training material.
