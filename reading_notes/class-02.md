# Dev Tools

<b>GitHub</b> is a service that helps developers store and manage their code. Development relies heavily on managing the version of the software, this is where the Git comes into play. Git is a version-control system that allows branching and merging of the repository. This type of editing allows the author or collaborators to safely work on the source code without making pernament edits that could disrupt the main development workflow. When code meets passing status, pull requests can merge with the source. 

GitHub vocabulary:
- <i>commit</i>: a saved state within the code.
- <i>branch</i>: a cloned version of the code, used to edit code without affecting the source.
- <i>pull request</i>: a permission asking the original author to include new code.
- <i>fork</i>: a copy of an existing repository but updates are not in sync with the original repo.

<b>VS Code</b> is a source code editor created by Microsoft. Also known as an Integrated Development Evnironment, IDE's assist in the entire software devlopment process, to include testing and compiling, as opposed to a plain text editor which is only responsible for writing code. VS Code allows the user to load custom extensions such as debuggers and cloud integration support. 

VS Code supports cloned repositries from GitHub and updates can be pushed directly onto GitHub.
