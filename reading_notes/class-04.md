# Troubleshooting Techniques

CompTIA A+ Troubleshooting Steps:

<b>Step 1)</b> Identify information to fully understand the possible problem. Ideally be able to duplicate the problem.

  Typically the issue has multiple symptoms, rather than just one thing. It’s crucial to document all in order to understand the entirety of the problem.

  Helpful tip: If the problem has occurred before or even habitually, the end-user is often familiar with the symptoms. So it can be very helpful to solicit their thoughts and observations. One good starting point is to look at recent changes in the environment. Breakdown and document multiple issues individually if occurring.

<b>Step 2)</b> Analyze the information collected. Making a list of all possible conceived problems can be useful, starting with the most obvious or most simple.

<b>Step 3)</b> Start testing your theories of possible resolutions for each problem, working from the top (most simple) down (most complex). E.g. use the process of elimination and start with the easiest variables to eliminate.

<b>Step 4)</b> After identifying the correct issue, it’s time to implement your theory to hopefully resolve; being mindful of the end-user’s “production window” and what is the most prudent time to implement with least amount of disruption to their work-flow.

  Additional tips:  Try to have a Plan B, maybe even Plan C in case your first theory doesn’t work.

<b>Step 5)</b> Test your fix to ensure the end-user is left with a properly functioning system.

  If possible, try to help the end-user with prevention of this issue going forward.

<b>Step 6)</b> Document everything you did for future reference and learning. Use that documentation to create a “plan of action” for future resolution of the issue.
